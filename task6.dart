* ! Task 6

* ? Title
** Find the longest substring with k unique characters in a given string

* ? Details
** Given a string you need to print longest possible substring that has exactly M unique characters. If there is more than one substring of longest possible length, then print any one of them.

* ? Example 1
** input (str: 'aabbcc', k: 1)
** output 2
** Explanation => Max substring can be any one from {“aa” , “bb” , “cc”} for exmaple we can get 1 unique (k) from substring 'aa' and the result will be 'a' note that the longgest subString is 2 character.

* ? Example 2
** input (str: 'aabbcc', k: 2)
** output 4
** Explanation => Max substring can be any one from {“aabb” , “bbcc”}.
